      Why LeBron James is one of my heroes.
    </p>
    <p>
        The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Outrageously courageous - they disturb the status quo and define a new normal</li>
        <li>Motivate others - people follow a great leader</li>
        <li>Big footprint - impact on millions and change the world</li>
        <li>Integrity - they live true to their calling</li>
    </ul>
    <p>LeBron James is one of my heroes because of what he does on and off the basektball court. 
    I've been watching LeBron play basketball since I was born and he made me love basketball.
    He is statistically one of the best players of all time and has 3 championships.
    That isnt the only reason LeBron is one of my heroes.
    Lebron is one of the few athletes that has never been in trouble and shows kids how to carry themselves the right way.
    He has done so much for his homwtown Akron, Ohio.
    Opening schools and providing housing for poor families are a couple of the things he has done.
    Another reason Lebron is on of my heroes is what he does for social justice.
