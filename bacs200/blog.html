     <h1> Why Climate Change is important.</h1>
   
    <p>
        Climate change is one of the most important issues of the 21st Century. 
        Climate change has caused some of the most catastrophic natural disasters. 
        In our home state of Colorado, we witnessed the ramifications of climate change this fall. 
        We saw 3 of the biggest wildfires in Colorado’s history this fall. If we dont change soon , 
        every year could be like 2020. Colorado isn't the only place seeing effects. 
        Melting glaciers have seen ocean levels rise causing panic for everyone living next to an ocean. 
        According to studies 800 million people will be affected by climate change. We need to make a change now.

 <p>
   Climate Change should be the least of our worries right now. 
   CoronaVirus is sweeping across the globe at an unstoppable rate. 
   Political tensions are at the  highest they’ve ever been and that doesn't include issues with social justice.
   How can we stop something we can't even see while these issues that affect us every day are not getting taken care off. 
   We should be putting people before the world and make sure that everyone is living as happily as they can.
